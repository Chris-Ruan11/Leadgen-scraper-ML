N Eddy current tube analysis, leak detection, vibration and oil analysis N Tube cleaning, retubing, gasket and tubesheet work N Improvements and updates Learn More Optimization & Retrofits  Central Plant Optimization (CPO) Our approach to optimization and retrofits begins at the central plant level. We implement advanced strategies such as load-based sequencing, condenser water reset driven by ambient wet-bulb conditions, and chilled water ΔT improvement. By incorporating pump and cooling tower VFD control alongside automatic setpoint optimization, we maximize system responsiveness and efficiency. Additional measures, including high-efficiency impellers, variable speed drives, and waterside economizer integration, further enhance performance. All improvements are tied together with robust controls integration, using BACnet/IP, Modbus TCP, and secure remote monitoring for seamless system operation.  Performance Benchmarking Every project is grounded in clear performance benchmarking. We establish a baseline that includes kW per ton, ΔT performance, demand charges, and condenser approach temperatures. From there, algorithmic sequencing and adaptive setpoints are applied to match real-time load and ambient wet-bulb conditions. Performance is validated with utility-grade trend reporting that provides clear before-and-after comparisons, ensuring transparency and measurable results.  Ongoing Monitoring & Assurance Optimization doesn’t end at installation - it requires continuous oversight. Our monitoring framework provides alarms for abnormal kW/ton, low ΔT, and short cycling, helping prevent inefficiencies before they escalate into costly issues.

Digital labor refers to technologies (such as AI automation and AI agents) that mimic human decision-making and cognitive abilities. It powers everything from lead nurturing to 24/7 customer support to campaign generation — extending human capacity at speeds and scales no human-only workforce can match. What is an Agentic Enterprise and what does it mean for my business? An Agentic Enterprise is a company where humans and AI agents collaborate seamlessly. Employees are enhanced by digital labor to boost productivity, unlock insights, drive results, and strengthen every customer relationship through trusted, data-driven experiences. This requires a deeply unified platform to deliver efficiencies that scale and customer success that lasts. What is the agentic era? The agentic era is a turning point in how work gets done. For the first time, AI doesn’t just respond to queries or perform simple repetitive tasks — it’s evolved to reason, adapt, and handle cognitive work once reserved for people. Employees gain digital partners that think, learn, and act alongside them — driving faster decisions, more personalized customer experiences, and productivity at a scale a human-only workforce could never achieve. How can my business become an Agentic Enterprise? Becoming an Agentic Enterprise starts with a clear vision and team alignment around your goals. From there, identify your initial high-impact use cases, transform your existing processes for humans and agents to work together, and build a trusted, unified data foundation that provides a single source of truth for every decision. By doing so, you can achieve the “dual dividend” of delighting customers and ensuring employee success.

"Tri-Technic, Inc.",https://www.tri-technic.com,1,"Home - Tri-Technic.com Skip to content Experts in All Aspects of the Power Supply Chain Yesterday’s systems and solutions will not succeed in the construction industry of tomorrow, nor will they sustain construction schedules or safety compliance and quality demands. That’s why we work hard to evolve ahead of the demands of our industries, bringing nearly 40 years of experience to the job. Our success comes from superior service to our clients. We will adapt to provide what you need, not duplicate what you already have. We are a team of progressive and experienced electrical construction professionals. Sectors We Support From design to construction, we succeed when you do. Generation The energy generation industry is at the threshold of its metamorphosis from the centralized heavy industry of the past, like the steel and mining industries of the 19th and 20th centuries, toward a more sustainable and eventually cost effective decentralized future. Tri-Technic supports any and all types of power generation facilities. » Delivery The electric national, regional and local power transmission and distribution network is the facility which transports and delivers bulk electrical energy from the generators, through our system of lines and substations, ultimately to all of us who need and use the energy, to build and sustain an advanced society, safe and comfortable communities, and the most vibrant economy on earth. » Utilization Energy utilization is where the energy supply meets the needs and demands of a civilized society. Utilization focuses on the equipment, appliances and technologies that provide for civilized life. All industries, life sustaining water, our food, sanitation, data and communications and every facet of civilized life, fades and dies without energy, delivered when, where and in the right quantity needed to sustain our lives and well-being. » Storage Energy storage is the only facility that can support the continued utilization of renewable energy in our electric power generation and delivery systems. Without Storage, continued penetration of renewables into our energy systems, will cause our entire system to fail and collapse. Storage in all its forms, is the only thing that fixes the problems that renewables create; Storage is critical. » Microgrids A microgrid is a relatively small, localized system of Energy Resources and Utilization Loads that typically operates connected to and synchronous with the traditional centralized power grid (macro-grid), but is able to disconnect and maintain local operation, autonomously as system reliability and/or economic conditions dictate. Currently Microgrids are built for sustainability and to support critical missions and operations, rather than energy economics. » We are experts in the most complex construction projects, excelling at the jobs that others avoid.

Mailchimp offers several AI marketing tools powered by Intuit Assist that make creating and managing campaigns easier. The inline text generation feature helps you write email copy faster when you're stuck or short on time. Beyond creation, you'll get recommendations for send times, content improvements, and pre-send tips that can boost performance, plus pre-built marketing flows that let you personalize messages beyond just using someone's first name. How can Mailchimp's AI features help improve my email campaign performance? Mailchimp's AI features focus on getting more people to open and click your emails. The send time and send day optimization tools analyze when your specific audience is most likely to engage, then recommend the best times to hit send. For deeper personalization, predicted attributes and pre-built marketing flows help you send more relevant content to each subscriber. This kind of AI customer segmentation typically leads to better engagement rates because people are seeing content that actually matter"

When are bugs most active? Swarm Season (Spring) As temperatures rise in early spring, pests become more active, emerging from their winter hiding spots to search for food and suitable nesting sites. Insects like termites and ants begin their swarming phase, looking to establish new colonies, while rodents and other pests start scouting for ideal environments to thrive. During this season, our exterminators will take proactive measures to deter infestations before they get out of hand. Breeding Season (Late Spring – Early Summer) With summer approaching, many pests shift their focus to reproduction, rapidly increasing their populations. Mosquitoes lay their eggs in standing water, flies become more prevalent, and cockroach activity surges in warm, humid conditions. Our services target these growing pest populations, preventing infestations before they escalate. High Season (Mid – Late Summer) Summer is peak pest season, with increased activity from mosquitoes , ants, wasps , and other warm-weather pests. Just as people spend more time outdoors, so do pests, which can lead to more frequent encounters and infestations. Our exterminators will take extra precautions to protect your home from the season’s most persistent pests, ensuring they don’t disrupt your summer. Prep Season (Early Fall) As temperatures start to cool, many pests begin preparing for winter by seeking shelter in homes and other structures. This is an ideal time to reinforce pest protection, sealing entry points, and reducing attractants before winter pests settle in. Our services focus on safeguarding your home ahead of their seasonal migration indoors. Invader Season (Late Fall – Early Winter) With cold weather setting in, pests like rodents, cockroaches , and spiders look for warmth and food inside homes. Small cracks, vents, and openings become prime entry points for these invaders.

Lubricating oil in the engine provides this vital service, but over time that oil breaks down and becomes contaminated with dust, dirt and debris from your engine as well as the environment. When that happens, oil can't do its job. Changing your oil and filter will help your vehicle's engine continue working at its best. Our certified technicians will consider the make, model, condition and mileage of your car before recommending the necessary oil change.We offer synthetic blend, high mileage or full synthetic oil change packages that are recommended based on your car's individual needs. All oil change packages include a tire pressure check, fluid level checks, washer fluid refill, tire rotation, visual brake check, standard oil filter and our 23-point inspection. Oil Change FAQs Q: How long does it take for an oil change? A: An oil change is an essential part of routine vehicle maintenance, but thankfully, it’s not really a time-consuming one. Generally speaking from the start of your service, you can expect your oil change to be completed within 30-45 minutes that includes a 23 point inspection, while a full service oil change inspection package takes roughly 45-60 minutes with a tire rotation included. Q: When does my car need an oil change? A: The short answer is, before sludge starts forming. The timing can really vary depending on the vehicle you’re driving, the conditions in which you’re driving, and how you drive. Look to your vehicle owner’s manual for a recommendation from the manufacturer, or bring your car into Meineke for a recommendation from one of our service professionals. Q: What is the price for an oil change? A: Every Meineke location has unique offers for the oil change your car needs. Please visit our coupons page - https://www.meineke.com/coupons-and-deals/ to explore available offers at your local Meineke. Q: What is included in an Exhaust and Muffler Shop Services | Meineke Muffler & Exhaust Shop Services The exhaust system in your car or truck’s engine ensures toxic fumes stay out of your car cabin and works to make your engine run correctly. It also helps give you the best possible fuel efficiency and cuts emissions that pollute the air. Because the process of a car engine is loud, a muffler is used to cancel out the sound. However, the muffler not only reduces the noise level, but also controls the back pressure of the engine. If your car or auto muffler has a hole, then you can experience a carbon monoxide leak, so it’s important to fix it right away for safety reasons. For muffler, exhaust system or straight piping work for autos, make sure you contact a professional exhaust shop or auto repair service, as a DIY muffler patch is never a good idea. Whether you need a new exhaust system, a replacement of your old muffler or current pipes, inspections, a new muffler, or simply work restoring current parts, contact your local Meineke auto repair near you. Book an appointment today at your local Meineke location Search The Best Muffler and Exhaust Repair Near You Looking for the best muffler shop near you? Find the Meineke Car Care center nearest to your location for muffler installation and exhaust service. Keeping Your Car Exhaust Pipe Maintained The exhaust pipe plays a key role in diverting exhaust fumes out of your engine, which in turn keeps your vehicle running smoothly. Built-up exhaust fumes can ultimately cause engine deterioration, which makes it important to have your exhaust pipe regularly inspected at a professional muffler shop. If You Hear a Vibration If you hear vibrating when your car is running or if it experiences a loss of power, bring it in for a free exhaust inspection. Let the shop know where you noticed the vibration coming from: the steering wheel, operating pedals, or even the seat. This symptom could be a result of a hole, disconnected part, or a leak in the exhaust system. The problem may or may not include a rumbling sound – that depends on the size of the damaged area. The vibrations are not just signaling a problem with the muffler or exhaust... they are also signals that your motor is likely not performing at peak levels. A Failing or Failed Catalytic Converter The catalytic converter is the most costly part of your exhaust system. If your catalytic converter begins to fail, you will hear loud sounds. A failing catalytic converter sounds like someone shaking a metal box filled with pennies while your car is idle. You may also notice your check engine light is illuminated. Increase in Exhaust Volume A deep rumbling noise coming out of your exhaust pipe is an obvious signal that you have a muffler or exhaust issue. Having it repaired quickly is the best option. Delaying needed muffler or exhaust repairs causes other exhaust and engine problems that make repairs more expensive. Decrease in Fuel Efficiency If you notice your regular fill-ups ar"

It reduces friction, lessens wear, lubricates metal engine parts, forms a seal between the pistons, rings and cylinder walls while helping to cool engine parts. Without the cleaning action of fresh oil, carbon and varnish buildup would be toxic to the engine. Want to help your engine run efficiently, maximize fuel economy, minimize emissions, and prolong the life of your car? Change your oil at the vehicle manufacturer's recommended intervals. How long does an oil change take? + - A Midas oil change takes about 60 minutes and includes oil and filter change as well as our complimentary Midas Closer Look Vehicle Check™. Oil Change Plus customers should allow another 15 minutes for tire rotation. A do-it-yourself oil change can take up to an hour, depending on how easily you can access the oil drain plug and filter on your vehicle. Types of Motor Oil + - Conventional motor oil is derived from crude oil with a variety of additives. Synthetic motor oil is derived from man-made ingredients with a variety of additives. Full synthetic oil protects your engine better than conventional oil due to the purity and uniform molecular structure of these man-made ingredients -- with added environmental benefits. Cost-saving synthetic blend oils are also available. Compare conventional oil vs. synthetic oil. High mileage motor oil contains anti-wear additives to prolong engine life in vehicles with 75,000 miles or more. It’s available in conventional, synthetic blend, and full synthetic oil formulas. Your Midas mechanic can help you choose the right motor oil for your vehicle and driving style – and we’ll never put any oil in your vehicle that fails to meet its manual specifications. Related: Can you mix synthetic and conventional oil? Can you switch back to conventional oil after getting a synthetic oil change? How often should oil be changed? + - For vehicles made in the past decade or so, automakers usually recommend changing the oil every 5,000 to 7,500 miles, with even higher intervals for certain models. Most owner’s manuals now specify synthetic blend or full synthetic oil in concert with these longer oil change intervals. Manufacturers recommend changing the oil every 3,000 miles for many older vehicles and certain engine types. The 3,000-mile oil change might be a sensible tradition to keep alive if you choose conventional oil. However, check your manual – and heed your vehicle’s oil change reminder if it triggers between oil changes, regardless of the old adage of every 3,000-miles.

Is your home in serious need of decluttering? If so, you’re far from alone. Most families have piles of unwanted items taking up valuable space in their garage, basement, or attic. Getting rid of all that stuff can be a major project, so it’s little surprise that more and more homeowners are hiring junk removal services for decluttering projects. At College Hunks Hauling Junk and Moving, we know how overwhelming it can be to declutter your home. We also know how much easier it is when you have professional help. With over 100 locations across North America, we’ve handled thousands of cleanouts and decluttering projects, saving homeowners countless hours of stress, sweat, and elbow grease. Despite the world of difference a junk removal company can make, many homeowners are hesitant to hire one. Instead, they make big plans to tackle the clutter themselves… and then find themselves staring at the same mountain of stuff a year later. So, before you dive headfirst into years of clutter buildup, you might want to pick up the phone and call the professionals. THE PROS & CONS OF JUNK REMOVAL & DECLUTTERING SERVICES If you’re unsure how to tackle your decluttering project, it’s worth examining the pros and cons of a junk removal service. Many homeowners underestimate the benefits while overestimating the drawbacks of these services. The most obvious, and perhaps only, downside of hiring a junk removal service is the cost. Many people feel uneasy about spending money on a job that they could do themselves, even if it would take several weekends to get the job done. In our experience, however, the cost of these services is lower than most homeowners expect. Many people also underestimate the value provided by a clutter removal service. Just think about how much time and energy it would take to dispose of all the clutter in your home. Then think about how much your time and energy are actually worth. Except for rare cases, the cost of hiring a junk removal service is typically much less than this figure. Meanwhile, the advantages of hiring a clutter removal company are practically limitless. As we’ve already covered, you’ll save a ton of time and energy by hiring professionals. More importantly, the project will actually get done. Not only will the project get done, it will get done the right way. A qualified junk removal service will train its employees in the best methods for removing different types of clutter. This allows them to remove large volumes of clutter in bulk, and it also means they can safely remove large, cumbersome items. This means the job gets done more quickly, it reduces the risk of damage to your home, and it eliminates the risk of injury"
